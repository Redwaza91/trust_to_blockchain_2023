## Read/watch and summarize (briefly, e.g. with some bullets)

I will summarize Anne Hautakangas' Helsec presentation on "I am a script kiddie, bypassing your antivirus software" from the Helsec May meetup in 2023.

* Anne Hautakangas' background is originally in front-end web development. She moved to do some business-related tasks but came back to the field of IT because of cybersecurity and Helsec.
* During her free time she does HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts and some volunteer work for Finland for cyber Finland)
* The goal of her presentation is to show what things can be achieved in malware development when one does not know anything about the topic, does not have any money nor much time.
* Anne developed a tiny piece of malware during her Christmas holiday to understand what malware does and how it infects a computer system, as she did not understand this beforehand.
* Anne makes a good analogy of computer viruses and malware to a crowbar. Computer viruses and malware can be compared to a crowbar in the way that it is not illegal to manufacture a crowbar or to buy one, as it is not illegal to create a malware or to even infect your own computer with your own malware. It becomes illegal when you decide to use the crowbar (or the computer virus) to break in to a person's house or computer.
* Anne started her project by researching in google different types of malware in order to find something simple that she can do. However, very soon it became apparent that simply doing a malware is not enough. One needs to also do some sort of antivirus evasion in order for the malware to be effective.
* Anne wanted to choose a path that can provide plenty of tutorials and also techniques that are currently being used by criminals, as they have proved successful and effective.
* She chose dll sideloading as the way to go.
* Anne provided an example attack with an exclusive party invitation which of course the victim would want to attend. The party invitaiton is sent to a victim and includes lots of different files zipped that the victim would expect to see: hotel reservations, restaurant reservations, transportation, etc. The victim downloads the package and opens a pdf-looking file which then infects the victim's computer.
* From the attacker's perspective, the pdf-looking file actually opens a copy of legitimate windows file. Usually it is rather small in size and uses dynamic link libraries (dll files). Whenever a Windows program is executed, it looks for the Window's dll files that it needs and uses them. DLL attacks abuse this dependency on dll files.
* Typically Windows uses the dll files located under the 'windows\system32' path, however, if a program finds the necessary dll file from the same path where it is located then it would use this dll file.
* In this malware example the sent package contains the pdf file, a legit copy of the windows program to execute, the malicious dll file and also a copy of the real dll file that the program is looking for.
* The attack unfolds by the victim opening the perfectly legitimate executable file, which opens the malicious dll file which then redirects the calls the real dll file so that the program does not crash and while the real program is executing the malicious code unloads a payload and contacts the attacker.
* Typically dll's are written in C++.
* Malware development tutorials expire very quickly as the operating systems patch found vulnerabilities all the time.
* One way to avoid malware detection and achieve antivirus evasion is to delay the malicious code execution with the hope that the antivirus software releases the program before the nasty stuff starts being executed. (Basically it pretends there is nothing out of ordinary)
* Usually malicious code tries to hide in real, legitimate windows processes, so that when the antivirus software scans the running processes it finds only what it expects to find.
* RunTimeBroker.exe is found in every Windows machine and is used by malicious software for piggybacking.
* The attacker has a post-exploitation framework running on his machine so that when a victim's machine gets infected it would secretly establish the connection to the attacker. This post-exploitation framework consists of ready made tools making it easier for the attacker to do nasty things without having to do them all from scratch. Anne used Sliver as the post-exploitation framework.
* For example, when the connection opens from the infected victim's computer to the attacker's computer, the attacker can send ready commands to the victim's computer using the post-exploitation framework, such as taking a screenshot of the victim's screen to see what they are doing.
* Malware can be made more credible by making the payload smaller and harder to detect.
* Real malware also uses better evasion techniques than simply delaying the execution of malicious code.
